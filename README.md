Welcome to the Repo Recipes assignment from The Odin Project project! In this assignment, I embarked on a journey to create HTML web pages showcasing various recipes. Throughout the project, I honed my skills in coding and formatting; ensuring that my web pages not only display the recipes effectively but also provides a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

By the end of this project, I demonstrated proficiency in:

<strong>HTML coding </strong>: <em>Crafting well-structured and semantic markup to represent content.</em>

Proper formatting: Ensuring readability and accessibility through consistent formatting and adherence to web standards.

Web design principles: Applying best practices to create aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interfaces.

Responsive design: Making my web pages adaptable to different screen sizes and devices for a seamless browsing
experience.

Through this README, I'll reflect on my journey, highlighting the lessons learned, challenges overcome, and the growth achieved in my coding skills. Let's dive in and explore the delicious world of recipes through the lens of web development!
